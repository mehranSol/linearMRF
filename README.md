# linearMRF

The library developed uses a linear moving reference frame (MRF) to simulate slug bubble rising in a vertical channel. The novelty of this work can benefit in reducing computational time, in which a bubble reaches its terminal velocity in a small channel with minor movements. 

This work has been done through C++, Object-Oriented code.
